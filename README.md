## Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio Page

This site is built purely with markdown and if able I will be updating using html/CSS/javascript. It will happen overtime and hopefully I will eventually ahev the whole site in HTML.

### For Possible Employers

This page is used for a better picture of me on top of my Resume. It has additional information about me, how I fared in CTF competitions, the blogs and write ups I have written, and any extra relevant information.
